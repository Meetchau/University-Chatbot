Chatbot README

This chatbot is a simple, rule-based conversational program where all its possible responses (called "intents") are defined manually. Because this is a small-scale project, this approach makes the chatbot easy to build and straightforward to manage.

How the Chatbot Works:

Intent Matching: The chatbot uses a list of predefined "intents" to determine the most appropriate response based on user input.

Pattern Recognition: It checks if the user's message matches any patterns associated with these intents.

Randomized Responses: Once a match is found, the chatbot picks a random response from the list of possible replies for that intent.

Case Insensitivity: All user input is converted to lowercase to avoid errors due to case sensitivity.

Fallback Response: If no pattern matches the user input, the chatbot will let you know it didn’t quite understand and suggest trying again.

Features:

The chatbot can handle a variety of simple interactions, including:

Greeting: Responds to common greetings like "Hi", "Hello", "What's up", etc.

Goodbye: Replies to exit phrases like "Bye", "See you later", and similar farewells.

Chatbot Name: Shares its name through a few different response options.

Working Hours: Provides the college’s working hours.

Contact Information: Shares a placeholder phone number for the college.

Course Information: Lists the courses offered by the college.

Fee Details: Provides a link where users can find more information about course fees.

How to Use:

Run the Script: Start the chatbot by running its Python script (or relevant executable, depending on your setup).

Type Your Message: Enter your question or message into the chat interface.

Get a Response: The chatbot will reply based on the patterns it recognizes.

Exit the Chat: If you want to end the conversation, type "exit", "quit", or "bye".

This chatbot is designed for simplicity and ease of use. It’s a great starting point for learning how rule-based conversational systems work!
