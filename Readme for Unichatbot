Chatbot README

So, this is a simple rule-based chatbot, where all the intents are defined manually. Since it's a small-scale chatbot, this approach is much easier and straightforward.

How It Works:
- The chatbot uses a list of "intents" to figure out the right response based on what the user says.
- It checks if the user input matches any of the patterns, and if it does, it gives a random response from the matched intent.
- It converts all the letters to lowercase to avoid any case sensitivity errors.
- If it doesn't find any match, it'll let you know it didn't quite understand and ask you to try again.

Features:
- Greeting: Replies to greetings like "Hi", "Hello", "What's up", etc.
- Goodbye: Replies to exit phrases like "Bye", "See you later", etc.
- Creator: Tells you that it was made by college students.
- Name: Lets you know its name, with a few options.
- Hours: Tells you the collegeâ€™s working hours.
- Contact Info: Gives a placeholder phone number.
- Courses: Lists out the courses offered by the college.
- Fees: Provides a link for fee details.

How to Use:
1. Run the script.
2. Type your message or question.
3. The chatbot will respond based on the patterns it finds.
4. If you want to exit, just type "exit", "quit", or "bye".

This is a small-scale chatbot, designed to be simple and easy to use!
